## GraphQL API

This application uses GraphQL. You can find the GraphQL playground at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.
Currently, the following queries are available:

### Basic queries

- `film(id: number)` - returns a film by id
- `allFilms(page?: number)` - returns all films, with optional pagination
- `planet(id: number)` - returns a planet by id
- `allPlanets(page?: number)` - returns all planets, with optional pagination
- `species(id: number)` - returns a species by id
- `allSpecies(page?: number)` - returns all species, with optional pagination
- `starship(id: number)` - returns a starship by id
- `allStarship(page?: number)` - returns all starship, with optional pagination
- `vehicle(id: number)` - returns a vehicle by id
- `allVehicles(page?: number)` - returns all vehicles, with optional pagination

### Additional queries

- `uniqueWords` - returns table of pairs (word-frequency) separated by `\n\r` characters, pairs based on the opening crawl of all films,
- `mostOftenName` - returns the most common name in the opening crawl of all films.

### Usage example

```graphql
query {
  film(id: 1) {
    title
    // rest fields
  }
}
```
